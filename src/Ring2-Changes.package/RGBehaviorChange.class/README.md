I'm a change related to a behavior. I must identify some way the behavior that is being changes (the origin). There are two options for that:

 1) The name of the behavior is known so I can identify it in the enviroment using it. It that case
    I do not need to store direct reference to the behavior, just its name (behaviorName)
 2) The name of the behavior is unresolved. In that case I need to set the direct reference
    to the behavior (behavior)
